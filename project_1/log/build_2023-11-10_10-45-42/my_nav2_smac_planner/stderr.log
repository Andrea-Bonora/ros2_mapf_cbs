[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:15 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findmy_nav2_core.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "my_nav2_core", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "my_nav2_core" with
  any of the following names:

    my_nav2_coreConfig.cmake
    my_nav2_core-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "my_nav2_core" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "my_nav2_core_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "my_nav2_core" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
